Administration and Maintenance
===============================

To maintain optimal database performance throughout the lifetime of
client solutions, Rackspace will perform the following activities:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - * Research, track, and/or apply vendor database software patches
     - * Monitor and correct health issues
   * - * Assist with data migration from development to quality assurance, and from quality assurance to production
     - * Support Oracle Enterprise Manager DB Console
   * - * Perform and monitor database backups
     - * Support Oracle Grid Control
   * - * Apply database changes at the client’s request
     - * Support MongoDB MMS

Migration
----------

Migrating databases can be complex, time-consuming, and costly if not
executed properly. Rackspace DBAs analyze, capture/recreate clients’
existing requirements as a part of “go-live”), and facilitate:

-  Initial environment assessment and recommendations

-  Clients’ in-house database(s) migrations to Rackspace facilities

-  Non-Rackspace hosted database(s) migrations to Rackspace facilities

-  Physical to Virtual Migrations (P2V) for legacy environments

-  Vendor-to-vendor migrations (e.g. Oracle to Microsoft SQL-Server) are
        possible in conjunction with a Professional Services migration
        engagement
