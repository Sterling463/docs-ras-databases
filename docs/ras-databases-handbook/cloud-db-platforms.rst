facilitates deploying, operating and scaling a relational database on
the AWS cloud. The AWS RDS system provides cost-efficient and resizable
capacity and database management tasks. Rackspace Solution Architects
and the Database Management team help design and manage databases
deployed in this manner for clients with a best practice approach in
terms of security, architecture and read/write requirements. Rackspace
supports AWS RDS deploying MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Aurora and
PostgreSQL all with the stack of database engines, compute, scale and
storage. RDS allows for HA designs with multi-AZ deployment and read

Rackspace can assist clients in determining a solution that meets their
requirements.

Rackspace is an Amazon RDS migration partner.
